For 1st question:
SELECT title, description from film; 

For 2nd question:
SELECT * from film WHERE length > 60 AND length <75; 

For 3rd question:
SELECT * from film WHERE rental_rate = 0.99 AND (replacement_cost = 12.99 OR replacement_cost =28.99); 

For 4th question:
SELECT last_name from customer WHERE first_name = 'Mary';

For 5th question:
SELECT * from film WHERE NOT length > 50 AND NOT (rental_rate = 2.99 OR rental_rate = 4.99);

For 5th question - an alternative way:
SELECT * from film WHERE length <= 50 AND (rental_rate != 2.99 AND rental_rate != 4.99);
